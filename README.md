Ignite Gym is a workout management application for gyms.

## 💻 About
Ignite Gym is an app that helps you manage your workout routines at the gym and gives you better control over the exercises you're doing. The app consumes a Node.js backend that provides a variety of exercises divided into categories, allowing you to filter by category and access the desired exercise to receive recommendations on how many sets to perform. After completing an exercise, you can mark it as done, and it will be saved to your history.

The application features a fully functional user registration system using authentication tokens, allowing you to manage your password and avatar.

Additionally, it works entirely with Async Storage, meaning that if you close the app, the data you entered will still be there the next time you open it.
